            dealings, we have outlined the following refund policy:
          </div>
          <h5>1. No Refunds:</h5>
          <div>
            Once a subscription plan is initiated and the agreement is signed,
            no refunds will be issued for the subscription period that has
            already been paid. This policy is in place to uphold the stability
            and reliability of our services.
          </div>
          <h5>2. Long-Term Agreement:</h5>
          <div>
            FleetBox subscription plans are structured for long-term
            commitments, fostering a strong and stable partnership. Early
            termination of the agreement will not warrant any refund.
          </div>
          <h5>3. Penalty for Early Termination:</h5>
          <div>
            In the event of premature termination of the agreement, a penalty
            will be applied. This penalty is designed to cover the costs
            associated with early termination and includes the forfeiture of the
            security deposit.
          </div>
          <h5>4. Security Deposit Forfeiture:</h5>
          <div>
            The security deposit, collected at the beginning of the
            subscription, serves as a commitment and security measure. Should
            the subscriber choose to terminate the agreement prematurely, the
            security deposit will be forfeited.
          </div>
          <h5>5. Exceptional Circumstances:</h5>
          <div>
            FleetBox recognizes that unforeseen circumstances may arise. In
            exceptional cases, such as force majeure events or circumstances
            beyond the control of the subscriber, the company may consider
            exceptions to this policy. Any such consideration will be made at
            the sole discretion of FleetBox.
          </div>
          <h5>6. Modification of Terms:</h5>
          <div>
            FleetBox reserves the right to modify the terms of this refund
            policy at any time. Subscribers will be notified in advance of any
            changes to the policy.
